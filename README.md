## 📖 About The Project

**Let It In** is an immersive psychological survival game that blurs the line between player and protagonist. Unlike traditional horror games, this project utilizes **real-time audio input** and **adaptive AI** to create a responsive environment where your *physical reactions* dictate your survival.

Designed to test critical thinking under pressure, the game forces players to solve complex psychological puzzles while being hunted by a custom-made AI entity. It serves not only as a game but as a simulation tool for high-stress scenarios, such as defense training or escape strategies.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎙️ Immersive Audio & Mechanics
* **Real-Time Breath Detection:** The game utilizes a sophisticated audio input system that monitors your microphone. If you breathe too loudly or make a sound in real life, the AI **will** hear you and react accordingly.
* **Dynamic Heartbeat System:** The in-game heartbeat audio intensifies and beats harder as the entity approaches, simulating an adrenaline spike and serving as a proximity warning.
* **"Only AI Can Open Doors":** A unique mechanic where physical progression is locked behind AI interaction. You cannot force your way through; you must negotiate with or outsmart the system to proceed.

### 🧠 Psychological Warfare
* **Critical Thinking Puzzles:** Navigate through a labyrinth of psychological traps designed to improve problem-solving skills under duress.
* **Defense & Escape Simulation:** Scenarios are modeled after real-life danger (e.g., child abduction escape, hostile territory infiltration). It teaches players to think clearly when panic sets in.
